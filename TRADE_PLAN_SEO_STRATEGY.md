# TradeCraft SEO Strategy Pivot: Trade Plan Focus

## Strategic Shift: From Generic Stock Analysis to Trade Plan Dominance

### Why the Current Approach is Wrong

The Phase 1 SEO implementation copied StockAnalysis.com's generic stock analysis model, which:

- ❌ Competes directly where we have no advantage
- ❌ Doesn't leverage our unique AI trade plan capabilities
- ❌ Creates static content that doesn't utilize our live data APIs
- ❌ Targets "investor" keywords instead of "trader" keywords
- ❌ Requires manual content creation instead of automation

### The Right Approach: Trade Plan SEO Dominance

**Core Insight**: TradeCraft's competitive advantage is AI-powered trade plan generation, not generic stock analysis. Our SEO should reflect this unique value proposition.

## New SEO Strategy: Dynamic Trade Plan Pages

### Target Keywords (High Commercial Intent)

```
Primary Keywords:
- "[STOCK] trade plan" (1,000+ monthly searches)
- "[STOCK] trading strategy" (2,000+ monthly searches)
- "[STOCK] swing trade setup" (500+ monthly searches)
- "how to trade [STOCK]" (1,500+ monthly searches)
- "[STOCK] entry exit points" (300+ monthly searches)
- "[STOCK] risk management" (800+ monthly searches)

Long-tail Keywords:
- "best entry price for [STOCK]"
- "[STOCK] stop loss calculator"
- "[STOCK] position sizing strategy"
- "when to buy [STOCK] technical analysis"
```

### Dynamic Page Architecture

**Route Structure:**

```
/trade-plan/[symbol] → Live AI trade plan for any stock
/trade-plan/[symbol]/swing → Swing trading plan
/trade-plan/[symbol]/positional → Positional trading plan
/trade-plan/[symbol]/longterm → Long-term trading plan
```

**Data Flow:**

```
User visits /trade-plan/AAPL
↓
Page calls existing trade-plan API
↓
Renders live, AI-generated trade plan
↓
Fresh data every page load
↓
Perfect SEO with real trading value
```

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor        | Their Strength        | Our Advantage                |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| StockAnalysis.com | Static financial data | Live AI trade plans          |
| TradingView       | Charts & community    | Actionable entry/exit points |
| Yahoo Finance     | News & basic data     | Professional risk management |
| Finviz            | Stock screening       | AI-powered trade setups      |

**Result**: We own the "trade plan" keyword space that no one else can compete in.
