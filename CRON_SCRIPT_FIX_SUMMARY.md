# Next.js Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Next.js Configuration Error

**Problem**: Next.js build was failing because `next.config.js` was using ESM syntax (`export default`) but Next.js config files require CommonJS syntax.

**Solution**: Converted `next.config.js` from ESM to CommonJS syntax:

```javascript
// Before (ESM - causing error):
export default nextConfig;

// After (CommonJS - working):
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

### 2. Cron Script Compatibility

**Current Status**: The cron script `scripts/refresh-momentum-screener.js` is using CommonJS syntax, which is compatible with the current project setup (no `"type": "module"` in package.json).

**Script Format**: Currently CommonJS (working correctly)

```javascript
const https = require("https");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");
```

## Testing Results
