# TradeCraft Chart Enhancement Summary

## âœ… Completed Improvements

### 1. Chart Data Loading Fixed

- **Issue**: Chart was displaying but with no data visible
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed data format to use Unix timestamps (seconds) instead of date strings
  - Corrected API usage: `chart.addSeries(chartLib.LineSeries, options)` instead of deprecated `addLineSeries()`
  - Added debug logging to verify data format

### 2. Extended Time Range

- **Issue**: Chart only showed 30 days of data, too short for meaningful analysis
- **Solution**:
  - Extended to 90 days (3 months) of historical data
  - Created realistic price movement patterns approaching entry zones
  - Added volatility and trend patterns for more realistic chart appearance

### 3. Entry Zone Visualization

- **Added**: Entry zone high and low lines (dashed blue lines)
- **Added**: Primary entry target line (solid thick blue line)
- **Added**: Visual distinction between entry zone boundaries and primary entry level

### 4. Enhanced Price Level Markers

- **Stop Loss**: Red solid line with "Stop Loss" label
- **Price Target**: Green solid line with "Price Target" label
- **Entry Levels**: Blue lines with varying styles for zone vs. target

### 5. Interactive Chart Markers

- **Added**: Arrow markers at the latest time point showing:
  - ENTRY arrow (blue, pointing up)
  - STOP arrow (red, pointing down)
  - TARGET arrow (green, pointing up)
- **Purpose**: Clear visual indicators for key price levels

### 6. Enhanced Legend

- **Added**: Entry zone range display when available
- **Improved**: Clear labeling distinguishing "Entry Target" vs "Entry Zone"
- **Format**: All prices formatted to 2 decimal places with $ symbol

### 7. Component Props Enhancement

- **Added**: `entryZone` prop to accept `{ low: number, high: number }`
- **Integration**: Connected to trade plan data structure
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with or without entry zone data

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
