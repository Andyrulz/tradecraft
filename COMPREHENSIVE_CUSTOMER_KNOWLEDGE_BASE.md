## üìã Frequently Asked Questions

### General Platform Questions

**Q: How accurate are the trade plans?**
A: Trade plans are based on technical analysis and historical data patterns. They are educational tools to help structure your trading approach, not guaranteed predictions. Always do your own research and never risk more than you can afford to lose.

**Q: What makes TradeCraft different from other platforms?**
A: TradeCraft combines AI-powered analysis with educational content. We focus on teaching you how to trade better, not just providing data. Our trade plan generator creates structured approaches to trading any stock.

**Q: Can I use TradeCraft for day trading?**
A: Yes! The platform supports various trading styles including day trading, swing trading, and long-term investing. Choose shorter timeframes for day trading strategies.

### Subscription & Billing Questions

**Q: Can I cancel my subscription anytime?**
A: Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time through PayPal. There are no cancellation fees or long-term commitments.

**Q: What happens if I downgrade my plan?**
A: You'll retain access to premium features until the end of your current billing period, then be moved to the lower tier plan.

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**
A: We evaluate refund requests on a case-by-case basis. Contact support within 7 days of purchase for refund considerations.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why is my data delayed?**
A: Free users receive data with a 15-20 minute delay. Premium subscribers get real-time data. This is standard practice due to exchange data fees.

**Q: What markets does TradeCraft cover?**
A: We primarily focus on US stock markets (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX). International markets may be added in future updates.

**Q: Can I export my trade plans?**
A: Yes, trade plans can be saved and exported for your records and further analysis.

### Trading Strategy Questions

**Q: Which strategy should I start with?**
A: Beginners should start with swing trading using longer timeframes (daily charts). This allows more time to make decisions and requires less screen time than day trading.

**Q: How much capital do I need to start trading?**
A: You can start learning with any amount, but for active trading, having at least $1,000-$5,000 provides more flexibility. Never trade with money you can't afford to lose.

**Q: Should I trust the AI-generated recommendations?**
A: Use AI recommendations as a starting point for your analysis, not as definitive trading signals. Always combine with your own research and risk management principles.
