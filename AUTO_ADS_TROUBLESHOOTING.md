# Google Auto Ads Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Auto Ads Only Showing One Ad at Bottom

### Why This Happens:

1. **Google Auto Ads are conservative** - They prioritize user experience over ad revenue initially
2. **New sites need time** - Auto Ads algorithm needs 1-2 weeks to learn your site
3. **Dynamic content challenges** - Auto Ads struggle with React/Next.js dynamic content
4. **Limited ad inventory** - Using same ad unit ID for all placements limits optimization

### Immediate Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. More Aggressive Manual Ad Placement

- **Increased frequency**: Every 3 articles instead of 6
- **Multiple ad types**: Using your working ad unit `2957844942` in different formats
- **Better spacing**: Added proper content sections for ad recognition
- **Mobile optimization**: More frequent mobile ad placements

#### 2. Enhanced Content Structure

- Added `ContentSection` wrapper for better Auto Ads recognition
- Implemented `NewsArticleWrapper` with content breaks
- Added ad placement hints and markers
- Enhanced section breaks every 2-6 articles

#### 3. Hybrid Strategy Improvements

- Kept Auto Ads enabled for additional opportunities
- Added manual ads using your working ad unit
- Better timing for ad initialization
- Enhanced Auto Ads configuration

### Testing Your Current Setup:

#### What You Should See Now:

1. **Top banner ad** (above fold)
2. **Multiple in-feed ads** between news articles (every 3 articles)
3. **Sidebar ads** on desktop
4. **Mobile sticky banner** at bottom
5. **Auto Ads** as additional placements (may take time to appear)

#### Testing Steps:

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload the page
2. **Test on mobile and desktop** separately
3. **Disable ad blocker** for testing
4. **Check browser console** for any errors
5. **Wait 30 seconds** for ads to load fully

### Expected Results Timeline:

#### Immediate (Today):

- Manual ads using your working ad unit should appear
- At least 3-5 ads visible on the news page
- Proper ad spacing between content

#### 1-3 Days:

- Auto Ads may start appearing in additional locations
- Google begins learning your site structure
- Ad fill rate should improve

#### 1-2 Weeks:

- Auto Ads will optimize placement based on user behavior

- Improved revenue performance

### If Ads Still Don't Show:

#### Check AdSense Dashboard:

1. **Ad serving status** - Ensure ads are approved
2. **Policy compliance** - Check for any violations
3. **Ad inventory** - Verify sufficient ad demand
4. **Geographic targeting** - Ensure ads available in your region

#### Technical Checks:

1. **Browser console errors** - Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Network requests** - Verify AdSense script loading
3. **Ad blocker detection** - Test without extensions
4. **Mobile testing** - Use real mobile devices

### Revenue Optimization Tips:

#### Medium Term (2-4 Weeks):

1. **A/B test ad positions** for optimal placement
2. **Implement lazy loading** for below-fold ads
