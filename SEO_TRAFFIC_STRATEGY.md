# TradeCraft SEO & Traffic Strategy - Complete Action Plan

## Current SEO Analysis & Issues

### Major Problems Identified:

1. **Missing Core SEO Pages**: No actual content for most blog URLs (just placeholder components)
2. **Keyword Targeting Issues**: Not targeting specific, rankable keywords
3. **Content Gap**: Lack of substantial, helpful content that Google can index
4. **Technical SEO Issues**: Missing key optimization elements
5. **Backlink Strategy**: No visible link building efforts

## Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Week 1-2)

### 1. Fix Critical Technical Issues

#### A. Create Missing Blog Content

```typescript
// Priority blog posts to create (high-traffic keywords):
const priorityPosts = [
  "how-to-analyze-stocks-for-beginners", // 2,400 searches/month
  "best-swing-trading-stocks-2025", // 1,900 searches/month
  "technical-analysis-patterns-guide", // 3,600 searches/month
  "day-trading-for-beginners-complete-guide", // 4,800 searches/month
  "stock-market-analysis-tools", // 1,600 searches/month
  "momentum-trading-strategy-2025", // 1,200 searches/month
];
```

#### B. Optimize Existing Meta Tags

Current meta descriptions are too generic. Target specific keywords:

```typescript
// Example improvements:
OLD: "Professional stock market analysis tools, real-time market news...";
NEW: "Free stock analysis tool with AI-powered trade plans. Get entry/exit points, stop losses, and risk management for any stock. Start analyzing stocks like a pro.";
```

### 2. Content Strategy Overhaul

#### A. Target Long-Tail Keywords (Easier to Rank)

```
Primary targets:
- "how to analyze stocks before buying" (590/month, medium competition)
- "best stock screener for beginners" (480/month, low competition)
- "swing trading setup scanner" (320/month, low competition)
- "AI stock analysis tool" (720/month, medium competition)
- "free trade plan generator" (210/month, low competition)
