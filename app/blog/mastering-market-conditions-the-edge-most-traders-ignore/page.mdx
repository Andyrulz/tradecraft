## “Do not trade every day of every year.” — Jesse Livermore

Every serious trader reaches a point where they realize this truth: the market, not your setup, determines your success.

You can have the sharpest stock screener, the cleanest chart patterns, and the most precise risk management — but if the general market environment isn’t supportive, all you’ll get is frustration and whipsaws.

In this post, let’s break down the 3 layers of market context that every trader should evaluate before risking a single dollar — and how to apply them in real-time.

### 1. Market Cycles: The Macro Rhythm Behind the Noise

Markets move in cycles — long-term rhythms that repeat not perfectly, but reliably enough to give you an edge. The three cycles that matter most are:

1. **10-Year Decennial Cycle:** Years ending in 4 (like 2024) have historically seen bullish turns.
2. **4-Year Presidential Cycle:** Midterm years often form bottoms, year 3 (pre-election) tends to be strongest.
3. **Seasonal Trends:**
   - Sept–Oct = volatility and bottoms
   - Nov–Jan = strength and rallies

Understanding these cycles doesn’t mean blindly following a script — but aligning your bias with historical tendencies can significantly improve your odds.

**What to do:** Mark key seasonal windows in your calendar. Use market strength in Nov–Jan to be aggressive. Tread carefully in historically weak periods.

### 2. Daily Market Environment: Are We Risk-On or Risk-Off?

This is your short-term weather report. While cycles give you climate, daily market metrics tell you what to wear today.

**Indicators to Watch:**

- VIX (Volatility Index)
- Put/Call Ratio (sentiment)
- % of stocks above 200-day MA (breadth)
- CNN Fear & Greed Index
- IBD Market Trend
- Bulls vs Bears Sentiment
- Proprietary Metrics (custom trend models, volatility compression, etc.)

These tools help answer one question: _Is the environment favorable for breakouts and trend trading today?_

When sentiment is greedy, breadth is wide, and volatility is low, go full throttle. When fear rises and few stocks are leading, scale back or sit out.

### 3. Stock Action: Is the Market Rewarding Good Behavior?

This is where rubber meets the road.

It doesn’t matter what the VIX says — if breakouts are failing and your trades are getting whipsawed, that’s the most honest feedback you’ll ever get.

**Ask yourself:**

- Are quality stocks breaking out and following through?
- Are they running or quickly returning to breakout levels?
- How has your portfolio performed over the last 5–10 trades?

When trades work effortlessly, that’s the green light. When even perfect setups stall, it’s time to wait or go defensive.

Your portfolio is your market thermometer. Trust it.

### Final Word

Markets don’t hand out profits evenly every day. The edge goes to those who wait for alignment — when cycles, sentiment, and stock action all say go.

So the next time you’re tempted to force a trade because you’re bored, remember Livermore:

> “Do not trade every day of every year.”

Instead, study the conditions. Respect the cycles. Trade when the odds are stacked in your favor.
