            Every serious trader reaches a point where they realize this truth: the market, not your setup, determines your success.
            You can have the sharpest stock screener, the cleanest chart patterns, and the most precise risk management — but if the general market environment isn’t supportive, all you’ll get is frustration and whipsaws.

          <p>Before risking a single dollar, evaluate these three layers of market context to stack the odds in your favor:</p>
        </section>
        <section className="mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Market Cycles: The Macro Rhythm Behind the Noise</h3>
          <p>Markets move in cycles — long-term rhythms that repeat not perfectly, but reliably enough to give you an edge. The three cycles that matter most are:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 my-2">
            <li><strong>10-Year Decennial Cycle:</strong> Years ending in 4 (like 2024) have historically seen bullish turns.</li>
            <li><strong>4-Year Presidential Cycle:</strong> Midterm years often form bottoms, year 3 (pre-election) tends to be strongest.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Trends:</strong> <br />
              <span className="ml-4">• Sept–Oct = volatility and bottoms<br />• Nov–Jan = strength and rallies</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Understanding these cycles doesn’t mean blindly following a script — but aligning your bias with historical tendencies can significantly improve your odds.</p>
          <div className="bg-sky-50 border-l-4 border-sky-400 p-4 rounded-xl shadow-sm my-4">
            <strong>What to do:</strong> Mark key seasonal windows in your calendar. Use market strength in Nov–Jan to be aggressive. Tread carefully in historically weak periods.
          </div>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Daily Market Environment: Are We Risk-On or Risk-Off?</h3>
          <p>This is your short-term weather report. While cycles give you climate, daily market metrics tell you what to wear today.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Indicators to Watch:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 my-2">
            <li>VIX (Volatility Index)</li>
            <li>Put/Call Ratio (sentiment)</li>
            <li>% of stocks above 200-day MA (breadth)</li>
            <li>CNN Fear & Greed Index</li>
            <li>IBD Market Trend</li>
            <li>Bulls vs Bears Sentiment</li>
            <li>Proprietary Metrics (custom trend models, volatility compression, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These tools help answer one question: <strong>Is the environment favorable for breakouts and trend trading today?</strong></p>
          <p>When sentiment is greedy, breadth is wide, and volatility is low, go full throttle. When fear rises and few stocks are leading, scale back or sit out.</p>
        </section>
        <section className="mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Stock Action: Is the Market Rewarding Good Behavior?</h3>
          <p>This is where rubber meets the road. It doesn’t matter what the VIX says — if breakouts are failing and your trades are getting whipsawed, that’s the most honest feedback you’ll ever get.</p>
          <p>Ask yourself:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 my-2">
            <li>Are quality stocks breaking out and following through?</li>
            <li>Are they running or quickly returning to breakout levels?</li>
            <li>How has your portfolio performed over the last 5–10 trades?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When trades work effortlessly, that’s the green light. When even perfect setups stall, it’s time to wait or go defensive. Your portfolio is your market thermometer. Trust it.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-primary">Bonus: Automate It All with TradeCraft</h2>
          <p>If this all sounds powerful — but hard to track manually — you’re not alone. That’s exactly why I created <a href="https://www.tradingsetup.pro/" className="text-primary underline font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TradeCraft</a>: a web-based platform that combines:</p>

            <li>Breakout planner tools</li>
            <li>Real-time market condition monitors</li>
            <li>Detailed Trade Plans</li>
          </ul>
          <p>…all in one place. Whether you’re a swing trader, a momentum hunter, or just trying to protect your capital in tough markets, <a href="https://www.tradingsetup.pro/" className="text-primary underline font-semibold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TradeCraft</a> gives you the edge of a full-time trading desk, simplified.</p>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-primary">Final Word</h2>
          <p>Markets don’t hand out profits evenly every day. The edge goes to those who wait for alignment — when cycles, sentiment, and stock action all say go.</p>
          <p>So the next time you’re tempted to force a trade because you’re bored, remember Livermore: “Do not trade every day of every year.” Instead, study the conditions. Respect the cycles. Trade when the odds are stacked in your favor.</p>
