          <h2>What Are Options?</h2>
          <p>
            Options are financial contracts that give you the right (but not the obligation) to buy 
            or sell an underlying asset at a specific price within a certain timeframe. Unlike 
            stocks, options have expiration dates and can lose value over time due to time decay.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Options Terminology</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Call Option:</strong> Gives you the right to buy a stock at a specific price</li>
            <li><strong>Put Option:</strong> Gives you the right to sell a stock at a specific price</li>
            <li><strong>Strike Price:</strong> The price at which you can exercise the option</li>
            <li><strong>Expiration Date:</strong> When the option contract ends</li>
            <li><strong>Premium:</strong> The cost to purchase the option</li>
            <li><strong>Intrinsic Value:</strong> The immediate exercise value of an option</li>
            <li><strong>Time Value:</strong> The portion of premium attributable to time until expiration</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Beginner-Friendly Options Strategies</h2>

          <h3>1. Covered Call Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            The covered call is one of the most popular options strategies for beginners. It involves 
            owning 100 shares of a stock and selling a call option against those shares to generate 
            additional income.
          </p>

          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Own 100 shares of a stock (long position)</li>
            <li>Sell one call option with a strike price above the current stock price</li>
            <li>Collect the premium from selling the option</li>
            <li>If the stock stays below the strike price, keep the premium and the shares</li>
            <li>If the stock goes above the strike price, your shares may be called away</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <p>
            You own 100 shares of XYZ stock trading at $50. You sell a call option with a $55 strike 
            price expiring in one month for $2 premium ($200 total). If XYZ stays below $55, you keep 
            the $200 premium. If it goes above $55, your shares are sold at $55, and you still keep 
            the premium.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 my-6">
            <div className="flex">
              <div className="ml-3">
                <p className="text-sm text-green-700">
                  <strong>Pros:</strong> Generate income from existing stock holdings, relatively low risk
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 my-6">
            <div className="flex">
              <div className="ml-3">
                <p className="text-sm text-red-700">
                  <strong>Cons:</strong> Limited upside potential, may miss out on large gains
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>2. Protective Put Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            A protective put involves buying a put option while owning the underlying stock. This 
            strategy acts like insurance for your stock position, limiting downside risk.
          </p>

          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Own 100 shares of a stock</li>
            <li>Buy a put option with a strike price below the current stock price</li>
            <li>Pay the premium for the put option</li>
            <li>If the stock falls below the strike price, exercise the put to limit losses</li>
            <li>If the stock rises, let the put expire and enjoy the gains</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <p>
            You own 100 shares of ABC stock at $60. You buy a put option with a $55 strike price 
            for $3 premium ($300 total). If ABC falls to $45, you can sell your shares at $55, 
            limiting your loss to $8 per share ($5 stock loss + $3 premium paid).
          </p>

          <h3>3. Cash-Secured Put Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            This strategy involves selling put options while holding enough cash to purchase the 
            underlying stock if assigned. It&apos;s a way to potentially buy stocks at a discount while 
            generating income.
          </p>

          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Hold cash equal to 100 shares of the target stock</li>
            <li>Sell a put option with a strike price you&apos;re comfortable buying the stock at</li>
            <li>Collect the premium from selling the put</li>
            <li>If the stock stays above the strike price, keep the premium</li>
            <li>If assigned, buy the stock at the strike price (effectively at a discount due to the premium)</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Advanced Beginner Strategies</h2>

          <h3>Bull Call Spread</h3>
          <p>
            A bull call spread involves buying a call option at a lower strike price and selling 
            a call option at a higher strike price. This strategy limits both risk and reward.
          </p>

          <h4>When to Use:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You&apos;re moderately bullish on a stock</li>
            <li>You want to reduce the cost of buying a call option</li>
            <li>You expect moderate price appreciation</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Bear Put Spread</h3>
          <p>
            Similar to the bull call spread but used when you&apos;re moderately bearish. You buy a put 
            at a higher strike price and sell a put at a lower strike price.
          </p>

          <h2>Risk Management in Options Trading</h2>

          <h3>Position Sizing</h3>
          <p>
            Never risk more than 1-2% of your total portfolio on a single options trade. Options 
            can expire worthless, leading to a 100% loss of the premium paid.
          </p>

          <h3>Time Decay Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Options lose value as they approach expiration. This time decay (theta) accelerates 
            in the final 30 days before expiration. Be aware of this when buying options.
          </p>

          <h3>Implied Volatility</h3>
          <p>
            High implied volatility increases option premiums. Avoid buying options when implied 
            volatility is extremely high, as it often reverts to the mean, reducing option values.
          </p>

          <h2>Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

          <h3>1. Buying Options Close to Expiration</h3>
          <p>
            Options lose value rapidly as expiration approaches. Give yourself time by buying 
            options with at least 30-45 days until expiration.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Not Having an Exit Plan</h3>
          <p>
            Always know when you&apos;ll take profits or cut losses before entering a trade. Many 
            successful traders take profits at 25-50% gains and cut losses at 25-50% of premium paid.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Ignoring Liquidity</h3>
          <p>
            Trade options with tight bid-ask spreads and decent volume. Wide spreads can 
            significantly impact your profits when entering and exiting positions.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Overleveraging</h3>
          <p>
            Options provide leverage, but this cuts both ways. Start small and gradually increase 
            position sizes as you gain experience and confidence.
          </p>

          <h2>Getting Started with Options Trading</h2>

          <h3>1. Education First</h3>
          <p>
            Before trading options, thoroughly understand the mechanics, Greeks (delta, gamma, 
            theta, vega), and various strategies. Paper trade to practice without risking real money.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Choose the Right Broker</h3>
          <p>
            Look for brokers with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Competitive options commissions</li>
            <li>Good options trading platform</li>
            <li>Educational resources</li>
            <li>Research tools and analytics</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Start Simple</h3>
          <p>
            Begin with basic strategies like covered calls or cash-secured puts. Master these 
            before moving to more complex strategies.
          </p>

          <h2>Tools for Options Analysis</h2>

          <p>
            Use <Link href="/trade-plan" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">
            TradeCraft&apos;s trade plan generator</Link> to analyze stocks before implementing options 
            strategies. Understanding the underlying stock&apos;s technical analysis is crucial for 
            successful options trading.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Metrics to Monitor</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Delta:</strong> How much the option price changes relative to stock price movement</li>
            <li><strong>Theta:</strong> Time decay rate</li>
            <li><strong>Implied Volatility:</strong> Market&apos;s expectation of future volatility</li>
            <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Number of contracts traded</li>
            <li><strong>Open Interest:</strong> Total outstanding contracts</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Tax Considerations</h2>

          <p>
            Options trading can have complex tax implications:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Short-term gains on options held less than a year are taxed as ordinary income</li>
            <li>Covered calls may affect the holding period of underlying stocks</li>
            <li>Consider consulting a tax professional for complex strategies</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            Options trading offers powerful tools for income generation and risk management when 
            used properly. Start with simple strategies like covered calls and protective puts, 
            focus on risk management, and gradually expand your knowledge and strategy repertoire.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember that options trading involves significant risk, including the potential for 
            total loss of premium paid. Never trade with money you can&apos;t afford to lose, and 
            always maintain proper position sizing and risk management.
